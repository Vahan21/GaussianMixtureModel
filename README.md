# Stock Predictor
Custom implementation of Gaussian Mixture model and K Means

### Short description
The project has 4 files: 'clustering.py' containing K means clustering, 'gaussian_mixture.py' containing gaussian mixture model
 , 'demonstrate_gm.py' to demonstrate the results and 'data.pickle' that contains the data I used to evaluate the model.

 The project is written in python 3.7 and numpy and also uses plots from matplotlib.
